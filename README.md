## Transforming Minds: Empowerment through Cognitive Rehabilitation

Mastishk is a platform designed to support children with learning disabilities, such as ADHD, Autism, Dyslexia, and more, by offering personalized cognitive rehabilitation solutions. The project aims to empower children, parents, and therapists with tools for personalized learning, real-time feedback, and progress tracking.

### Problem Statement
Learning disabilities are neurodevelopmental disorders that significantly affect a person's ability to perform tasks such as reading, writing, or paying attention. Many individuals remain undiagnosed, which can lead to challenges in everyday life. The current manual methods for cognitive retraining are time-consuming and difficult to track, which leads to the need for a better digital solution.

- Create **individual profiles** for each child to track cognitive strengths and weaknesses.
- Engage in **interactive games and activities** designed by experts, tailored to target specific cognitive skills.
- Receive **real-time feedback** on performance to monitor progress and celebrate achievements.
- Collaborate with therapists and experts to create **personalized learning plans**.

### Key Features
1. **Personalized User Experience**: Custom user profiles for individualized game recommendations.
2. **Interactive Games**: Includes games such as:
   - Flipping Tiles
   - Red Light Green Light
   - Phonic Explorer
   - Tic Tac Toe
   - Matching Game
   - Simon Game
   - Maths Equation Game
3. **Real-Time Feedback and Progress Tracking**: Users can track progress with feedback to identify strengths and weaknesses.
